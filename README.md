# tStandalone, a standalone mod for Terraria 1.4.0.5!

tStandalone is an open-source, heavily modified fork of tModLoader's 1.4 beta branch. tStandalone is **not** a mod loader and never will be a mod loader.
tStandalone is a combination of different modifications for Terraria 1.4.0.5 by myself (Stevie) and other contributors.

**Note**: tStandalone is currently unreleased and likely won't be released for a while.
